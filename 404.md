## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm the error message sent when the requested page you're after can't be found online. I also do a wee bit of (very amateur) interpretative dance in my spare time.

## What hardware do you use?

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. It's something rack-mounted, I think. Or, y'know, a freaking MacBook Pro?!

## And what software?

I have a serious interest - let's be honest, it's an obsession - with web server software. Always been there, can't explain it. But I'm a simple creature, so that's it for me, really.

## What would be your dream setup?

Truthfully, I'm pretty happy with my current setup. I would love it if people were more careful with the URLs they typed, though, y'know?
